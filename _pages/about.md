I am a theoretical and computational physicist with interest in spin-dependent phenomena in solid-state systems. Currently I am working in the group of Prof. [Michael Flatt√©](https://frg.physics.uiowa.edu) at the University of Iowa.

I have experience in modeling electronic structure and spin-dependent transport in semiconductors and
device structures. Skilled in C++ and Python programming for scientific calculations and visualization
including for density-matrix evolutions and electric-field-induced dynamics. Also acquired extensive
experience during my PhD studies in ab initio calculations with commercial and open-source codes and developed
C++/MPI research codes. These days I primarily work in C++ and Python, but I have coded in Julia, Fortran, Mathematica and Javascript in the past as well.

I worked at [QuantCAD](http://www.quantcad.com) as Principal Investigar (PI) in two NASA SBIR projects and one DARPA award where I performed computational simulations of spin-dependent phenomena in semiconductors for quantum sensing applications and managed projects involving multiple teams from both industry and academia. I helped to write technical proposals for DOE, NSF, DARPA and NASA. I developed Lindblad density-matrix solvers on top of QuTiP for simulating the dynamics of open quantum system and incorporated Monte Carlo device simulation and calculations of spin dephasing and decoherence of NV-center sensors varying environmental conditions
